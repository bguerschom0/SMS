# School Management System Implementation Guide

## Introduction

The School Management System (SMS) is a comprehensive web application designed for primary and nursery schools, with a primary focus on accounting functions. The system helps track student fees, payments, expenses, and generates financial reports, while also providing extensibility for other school operations.

This guide provides detailed instructions for implementing the system from start to finish.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern single-page application (SPA) architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend**: React.js with TailwindCSS for responsive UI
2. **Backend/Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for data storage and authentication
3. **Hosting**: Vercel for continuous deployment
4. **Version Control**: GitHub for source code management

```

Edit `tailwind.config.js` to configure paths and theme colors:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          // Indigo shades
          50: '#EEF2FF',
          100: '#E0E7FF',
          // ... additional shades
          600: '#4F46E5',  // Primary color
          // ... additional shades
        },
        // ... additional color configurations
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

### 2. Database Setup with Supabase

1. Create a Supabase account and project at [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Execute the database schema SQL (refer to `supabase-schema.sql`) in the Supabase SQL editor
3. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies for the tables
4. Configure authentication settings

Create `.env` file in the project root:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Authentication Implementation

Create `src/services/supabase.js` to initialize the Supabase client:

const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseAnonKey) {
  console.error('Supabase URL or Anonymous Key is missing.');
}

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);

// Additional API functions for CRUD operations
// ...
```

Implement the AuthContext and related components to manage authentication state:

```javascript
// src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { supabase } from '../services/supabase';

const AuthContext = createContext();

export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check current user and set up auth subscription
    // ...
  }, []);

  const value = {
    user,
    loading,
    signIn: async (email, password) => {/* ... */},
    signUp: async (email, password) => {/* ... */},
    signOut: async () => {/* ... */}
  };

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);
```
