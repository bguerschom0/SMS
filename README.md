2. **Pages**: Main application screens
   - Dashboard
   - Payments (list, details, form)
   - Students (list, details, form)
   - Expenses (list, details, form)
   - Reports
   - Settings

3. **Services**: API communication
   - Supabase client
   - Authentication
   - Data services

4. **Contexts**: Application state management
   - Authentication context

5. **Utils**: Utility functions
   - Formatters
   - Validators

## Implementation Status

So far, we have:
- Created the project structure
